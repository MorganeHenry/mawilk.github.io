	<h1 class="Title">The alignments of Carnac</h1>
	<p class="Tips">Impossible to spend holidays in Morbihan without a historical parenthesis. If Stonehenge is probably the most famous megalithic complex, Carnac is the most concentrated megalithic sanctuary in the world!</p>

	<h3 class="Title2">World famous menhirs</h3>
	<p>In Morbihan, more than 550 megalithic sites have been identified. 7,000 years old, the megalithic site of Carnac, the most famous of the region, remains a Mecca of European Prehistory. It is classified as a historical monument since 1889. Nestled in southern Morbihan, the megaliths of Carnac are distinguished by their incredible alignment. Built between the 5th and the 3rd millennium BC, the two main sites (Menec and Kermario) together alone nearly 3000 menhirs. These alignments extend for almost 4 kilometers! Menhirs, dolmens, tumuli and other remains bear witness to Neolithic architecture.</p>
	<p>The stones are placed in descending order and each alignment ends on a megalithic enclosure more or less visible.</p>
	<h4 class="Title2">Why all these stones erected and aligned?</h4> <img class="Menhirs2" src="Menhirs2.jpg">
	<p>There are many hypotheses that try to explain the origin of alignments: religious monuments, worship of the moon or the sun, calendar for agriculture or Roman army transformed into stones according to a legend ... the mystery remains! The remains of this prehistorian period still suggest that they had a sacred and funerary function.</p>
	<p>In order to protect these ancestral monuments and to enhance this exceptional heritage, the cities pool their resources to inscribe the megaliths of southern Morbihan in UNESCO World Heritage. The Paysages de Megalithes association was created and supports the project.</p>
	<p>The alignments of Carnac are available for free visit from October to March. From April to September, only paid conference tours allow you to enter the sites.</p>
