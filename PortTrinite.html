	<h1 class="Title">The Trinité-sur-Mer and The Port de la Trinite</h1>
	<h3 class="Title2">History and Heritage</h3><img class="trinite2" src="trinite2.jpg">
	<h5 class="Tips"> La Trinité-sur-Mer is a city rich in history and heritage.</h5>
	<h4 class="Title2">A city facing the sea</h4>
	<p>The first traces of the village and its port date from the thirteenth century but it is in 1864 that the town becomes La Trinité-sur-Mer. The village, which thrives on maritime commerce, must, as a result of a governmental measure in 1931, cease this activity and turn to fishing; the old auction, demolished in 1923, is rebuilt. The city serves as a refuge for 500 ships a year, in addition to the 300 fishing boats attached to it. The increase in traffic and the arrival of motorized trawlers between 1945 and 1954 necessitated the renovation of the port.</p>

	<p>From the eighteenth century, the first oyster beds appear in the channel. This privileged location in one of the most beautiful rias of southern Brittany earned it the title of "Cradle of the flat oyster". Very flourishing until 1922, oyster farming - the first to be affected by the flat oyster disease - is going through difficult years before recovering to become today a flagship activity of the city.</p>

	<p>Always oriented towards the sea which remains its richness and the base of its development, La Trinité-sur-Mer is committed since the years 1960-1970 in the yachting and becomes the home port of famous racing sailboats.

	<h4 class="Title2">The village, character and authenticity</h4><img class="trinite" src="trinite.jpg">
	<p>Located high and overlooking the port, it is born thanks to the gathering of some thatched cottages around the chapel before extending towards the sea, source of prosperity. Dominating the harbor, the village stretches in narrow and winding narrow streets around a typical Breton village architecture. Its small but opulent 19th century fishing houses and dry stone walls add character and authenticity.</p>

	<p>The barracks, the rue du Vieux-Puits, the rue de la Vigie, the alley of the Guetteurs, the public school of boys which was the Town hall, the house of associations and the cemetery with its magnificent classified camellia, are so many riches of Trinidad-on-Sea.</p>

	<h4 class="Title2">A rich maritime heritage</h4>
	<h5 class="Title2">The port</h5>
	<p>Originally, the port ended in cul-de-sac at the current location of the Town Hall. It is in 1958, at the time of the piercing of the tourist road towards Carnac Plage, that the port begins its renovation to adapt to the traffic of the commerce, the fishing, then the yachting. Today, the port of La Trinité-sur-Mer can boast of being able to accommodate more than 2,000 pleasure boats and the biggest sailing boats. Renowned for its winter training and its important nautical competitions, the port of La Trinité-sur-Mer is also a starting point towards the bay of Quiberon, the Gulf of Morbihan or the paradisiacal islands Belle-Île, Houat or Hoëdic.</p>

	<h4 class="Title2">The salt works of Kervillen</h4><img class="trinite3" src="trinite3.jpg">
	<p>They are, from the 18th century, the most important of La Trinité-sur-Mer. Salt is stored in "salt granaries" of which only one remains. In the 1960s, Job Guennec, a salt miner at Kervillen, had to abandon his salt business after twenty years of exploitation. Long neglected, the marshes are bought in 1980 by the General Council of Morbihan before being entrusted to Damien Phélip in 2006.</p>

	<p>The rehabilitation of the site began in 2010 with major mechanical work funded by the General Council. Damien Phélip then carried out a meticulous work with the help of paludiers of Guérande. Manually, they recreated the salt marshes as we can see them today.</p>

	<p>After two years of work, this enthusiast has revived the saline of Kervillen. The first salt harvest took place in 2013 and the marketing started on August 1st, 2014. After a beautiful season 2016 and a harvest of 25 tons of coarse salt and a ton of fleur de sel, the saline activity resumed its place in the Trinidad landscape.</p>

	<h4 class="Title2">A site rich in biodiversity</h4>

	<p>Kervillen has been rehabilitated as part of the preservation of sensitive natural environments. These marshes are a real wealth in terms of local biodiversity and today shelter some forty different species of animals. The salt worker works exclusively manually to preserve this natural environment full of life.</p>

	<p>Birds can nest on the islets. Since 2012, many species return there offering a great ornithological wealth (avocets, stilts, plovers, terns, mallards ...)</p>

	<h4 class="Title2">The mudflats are home to growing fish and other plankton.</h4>

	Ty Guard, located at the tip of Kerbihan, was used to house the customs officers who guarded the coast. Today private, this house remains the symbol of the tip of Kerbihan and offers a magnificent view of the bay of Quiberon.
