For the website, I realized something a bit more advanced.
The first html launched is "Home.html", all the others are then integrated.
Of course, not everything is to read, you can however, take a quick look at each page, using the Menu.

Home.html was changed later, indeed links .html had been placed but were not made (error on my part)
